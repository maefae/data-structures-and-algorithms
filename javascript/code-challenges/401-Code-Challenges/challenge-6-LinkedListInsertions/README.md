# Challenge 06 - Linked List Insertions

Extending the LinkedList class from Challenge 05. Adding three new methods:

.append(value): which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insertBefore(value, newVal): which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node.
insertAfter(value, newVal): which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node.
