The functions should receive an array of movie objects, and each movie object should have a title (string), year (number), and list of genres (array of strings). One function should sort the movies by most recent year first, and then the other function should sort the movies by title (They need to ignore any leading "A"s, "An"s, or "The"s.

Test the functions with an array of sample data within test.js and movies.js.
Then write tests for comparator functions.
