# Challenge

Write a function called validate brackets that takes in a string as an argument and returns a boolean

# Approach and Efficiency

My approach is that I will do a couple loops with several logic statements. I will loop over the entire input to find brackets and store them into a temp array.
Time complexity: O(n)
Space: O(n), because the entire string could be brackets. Then, I will loop a second time over all brackets, while pushing and popping off brackets.
